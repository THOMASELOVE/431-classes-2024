## Quiz 1 

- **Later today**, you will receive an email from me containing:
    - your answers to every question, and the answer key
    - a breakdown of the points you received on every question
    - your raw and final score on the Quiz
- A set of Answers and a summary of Results across all 54 students is **available now** as a PDF in our Shared Google Drive folder. Look for the "Answers and Results for Quiz 1" subfolder within "431 Quiz 1 Materials." It's a 45 page document, so it'll take you some time to look through it all.
    - Nonetheless, I'm asking you to read through the document and the email I will send to you **before** you ask me any questions about grading and the Quiz. I am very likely to have answered your question within those documents.
- At the end of the PDF document is a summary of how the class did, and an **explanation** of how your score on Quiz 1 was calculated.
- Most of the grades were in the A or B range, so that's great.
- Here is our advice to you about the Quiz...
    1. If, after you get your email with your grade, you realize that you didn't do as well as you'd like on the Quiz, go over the provided Answer Sketch (PDF) in our Shared Google Drive folder to see where you went wrong, and if you still don't understand something about why my answer is correct, ask us about it on Campuswire or in TA office hours. If you have a question about grading, specifically, on Quiz 1, email Dr. Love **before October 24** after which time he will consider Quiz 1 closed. Then forget about the Quiz, and work on Project A.
    2. If, after you get your email with your grade, you realize that you did do well on the Quiz, great! Go over the provided Answer Sketch (PDF) in our Shared Google Drive folder to see where you had trouble matching our response, and if you still don't understand something about why my answer is correct, ask us about it on Campuswire or in TA office hours. If you have a question about grading, specifically, on Quiz 1, email Dr. Love **before October 24** after which time he will consider Quiz 1 closed. Then forget about the Quiz, and work on Project A.
