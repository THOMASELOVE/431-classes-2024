## Quiz 1 

- Most of the grades were in the A or B range, so that's great.
- Here is our advice to you about the Quiz...
    - If you didn't do as well as you'd like on the Quiz, go over the provided Answer Sketch (PDF) in our Shared Google Drive folder to see where you went wrong, and if you still don't understand something, ask us about it on Campuswire or in TA office hours. Then forget about the Quiz, and work on Project A.
