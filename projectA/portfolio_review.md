# Project A Portfolio Status

## Current Status

- Reviews of R data sets, self-evaluations, Quarto and HTML files are done for all 42 projects.
- Reviews of  videos are also done for all of the projects marked below with Review Status **Complete**.

- Remaining tasks are: (1) finishing the video reviews indicated below, and (2) aggregating our feedback into documents we can send to you. I hope to send those via email before 9 AM Tuesday 2024-11-12.
- I built an **example of a video** which (in just under three minutes) lets me accomplish the things I was hoping to see in Analyses 1 and 3, based on a student's project.
    - Material posted to our Shared Drive folder under **Project A Example Video** includes an mp4 video from me, and a Word document containing the results I summarize in the video.
