# Project A Portfolio Status

**Current Stage**: We've completed all reviews of the R data sets, self-evaluations, Quarto and HTML files, and I've awarded your fraction of 90 of the 120 total points available.

- All that's left are the videos, which are not yet complete, and then the aggregation into documents we can send to you. I honestly don't know when that will be finished.
- I am in receipt of all "partner" notes, all Self-Evaluation forms and all R data sets, video, Quarto and HTML files.
