## Announcements

1. The answer sketch for Lab 2 is available in the Lab Answer Sketches section of our Shared Drive folder.
2. Grades and feedback on Lab 2 should be posted **by class time**.
3. You can use [LaTeX commands within Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.html). Just enclose them in dollar signs, like `$\leq$`, which produces $\leq$.
    - Check out the bottom of [this page](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions) for a brief reference guide and links to learn more.
4. Lots of good questions [on Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/) this week. Thanks!
5. In Project A,
    - the only things that really ought be factors are the `state` variable and the binary version of your Analysis 2 outcome.
    - you should be using `droplevels()` (which drops unused levels from all factors) once you have an otherwise clean `chr_2024`, and before you save the .Rds file.
    - you should review the general tips [posted here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/blob/main/tips.md) for Labs and Project work.
6. Please don't forget to submit all **three** necessary parts of the Project A Plan to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu) by Wednesday at noon.
    - The three parts are (1) the analytic tibble (.Rds file), (2) your Quarto (.qmd file), and (3) your HTML result of rendering your Quarto file.
    - The resulting HTML document will have 14 sections. Be sure they all appear in your Table of Contents, and that the links in that Table of Contents work.
    - If you are working with a partner, **exactly one** of you should submit the materials to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu), and the **other partner** should submit a text document (Word or PDF is fine) to Canvas that reads: "My name is [YOUR NAME]. I am working on Project A with [INSERT FULL NAME OF YOUR PARTNER], and they will submit the materials for the Plan". This, too, is due by Wednesday at noon.
7. There is no Minute Paper this week. The next [Minute Paper will follow Class 11](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-minute-2024).
