## More to come.


## Shameless Self-Promotion

I'm [in a play](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater/blob/master/README.md#my-next-performances-will-be-as-justice-wargrave-in-the-play-and-then-there-were-none-at-aurora-community-theatre-october-25---november-16-2024) that runs from October 25 - November 16. You'll hear more about this in October, but if you want to get tickets now, [visit this link](https://www.auroracommunitytheatre.com/). 

### If I'm a student/friend/neighbor/colleague of yours, are you expecting me to come see you in theater?

I'm always delighted to see anyone I know at any show I do. Please do come if you are interested, and comfortable being around people who are unmasked. I also have various professional roles (as a teacher, for example) where I have some nominal control over other people's happiness or work. If you're someone who interacts with me professionally, please feel no obligation to attend a show I'm in. Attending (or not attending) a show I'm in carries **no** weight with me at all in any professional capacity.
