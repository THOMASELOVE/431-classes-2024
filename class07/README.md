## Announcements

1. I posted a revised version of the [Lab 2 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/tree/main/lab2) on 2024-09-13 to correct a typo. The original version (in one place) suggested there were 5 tasks. There are, in fact, just 3.
    - The Lab 1 Answer Sketch was posted last Friday at noon to our Shared Google Drive.
    - **Grades** for Lab 1 will be posted by class time.
2. In addition to Lab 2, the Minute Paper after Class 07 is due Wednesday at noon. **Link to be posted**.
3. [Chapters 9](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/09_moregroups.html), [10](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/10_transmore.html), [11](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/11_association.html) and [12](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/12_transassoc.html) of our [Course Textbook](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/) are now ready for you, in addition to Chapters 1-8 and the Appendix materials, which have been available previously. Chapters 13-23 still need work on my part before I can recommend you read them.
    - I also corrected a typo (I was missing a parenthesis in describing what outliers and serious outliers are) in [Section 3.5](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/03_summary.html#sec-outliers) thanks to an alert student.
4. David Spiegelhalter's writing in [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-spiegelhalter) may be of interest to you.
5. Rebecca Barter's [An introduction to Python for R Users](https://rebeccabarter.com/blog/2023-09-11-from_r_to_python) has been helpful to some people making that transition, or the opposite one.

## Favorite Movies

Consider the `movies_2024-09-17` Google Sheet now found in our Shared Drive. 

- This file describes **228** movies selected as a "favorite movie" by students in 431 in the Fall 2020-2024 versions of the course.
- We'll start by exploring the data a little, and look at how I developed the codebook.
