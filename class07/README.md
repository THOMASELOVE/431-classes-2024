## Announcements

1. I posted a revised version of the [Lab 2 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/tree/main/lab2) on 2024-09-13 to correct a typo. The original version (in one place) suggested there were 5 tasks. There are, in fact, just 3.
    - The Lab 1 Answer Sketch was posted last Friday at noon to our Shared Google Drive.
    - **Grades** for Lab 1 will be posted by class time to our Shared Google Drive, and specifically **not** to Canvas. Look for my email dated 2024-09-16 for more details.
2. In addition to [Lab 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/tree/main/lab2), the Minute Paper after Class 07 is due Wednesday at noon. **Link to be posted**.
3. [Chapters 9](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/09_moregroups.html), [10](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/10_transmore.html), [11](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/11_association.html) and [12](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/12_transassoc.html) of our [Course Textbook](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/) are now ready for you, in addition to Chapters 1-8 and the Appendix materials, which have been available previously. Chapters 13-23 still need work on my part before I can recommend you read them.
    - I also corrected non-critical irritating typos in [Section 3.5](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/03_summary.html#sec-outliers) and in [Section 7.5](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/07_transform.html#the-logarithmic-transformation) thanks to alert students who have received some credit for letting me know. Email or Campuswire is great for letting me know if you find other errors.
4. David Spiegelhalter's writing in [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-spiegelhalter) may be of interest to you.
5. Thursday September 19 is every R user's favorite holiday. I'll be sure to let you know about it next time in class.

## Favorite Movies

Consider the `movies_2024-09-17` Google Sheet now found in our Shared Google Drive. 

- This file describes **228** movies selected as a "favorite movie" by students in 431 in the Fall 2020-2024 versions of the course.
- Today, we'll describe the data gently, and talk a bit about how I developed the codebook.

## One Last Thing

To come.

## Shameless Self-Promotion

I'm [in a play](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater/blob/master/README.md#my-next-performances-will-be-as-justice-wargrave-in-the-play-and-then-there-were-none-at-aurora-community-theatre-october-25---november-16-2024) that runs from October 25 - November 16. You'll hear more about this in October, but if you want to get tickets now, [visit this link](https://www.auroracommunitytheatre.com/). 

### If I'm a student/friend/neighbor/colleague of yours, are you expecting me to come see you in theater?

I'm always delighted to see anyone I know at any show I do. Please do come if you are interested, and comfortable being around people who are unmasked. I also have various professional roles (as a teacher, for example) where I have some nominal control over other people's happiness or work. If you're someone who interacts with me professionally, please feel no obligation to attend a show I'm in. Attending (or not attending) a show I'm in carries **no** weight with me at all in any professional capacity.
