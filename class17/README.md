## Announcements

1. Today's Class 17 is an "Ask Me Anything" / Project A Help Session conducted by Dr. Love over Zoom during our usual class time. So far, there are no slides.
2. Your [Project A Portfolio](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2024/) is due Wednesday 2024-10-30 at Noon.
    - Completing the portfolio means sending your (1) R data set, (2) Quarto file, (3) HTML result of rendering the Quarto file, and (4) video file (maximum 3 minutes, highlighting 2 of your analyses) to us via [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu), then completing [the self-evaluation form](https://bit.ly/431-projectA-self-evaluation-2024), all by the deadline.
    - Be sure to review the [detailed instructions for the highlight video](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2024/portfolio.html#the-highlight-video) in the instructions carefully. Details matter.
3. Once you've completed Project A, good things to work on are [Lab 5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/tree/main/lab5) and [especially Lab 7](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/tree/main/lab7), which are now available to you, and which you should be able to do with what we've studied already.
    - Lab 7 involves building a web site for yourself. Here, for example, is [one student's new site](https://tatchaporn.github.io/tatchaporn/), built using [the Marvin Schmitt tutorial mentioned in the Lab instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/blob/main/lab7/README.md#using-quarto-to-build-the-site).
4. If you're concerned about your grade in the class, I'd work on demonstrating your best possible effort on Project A. After that, I'd get to work on [Lab 7](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/tree/main/lab7) as quickly as possible.
5. Our next class (Class 18) will be held Tuesday 2024-10-29 at the usual time, and in person. After that class will come our next Minute Paper, due 2024-10-30 along with Project A.
6. We will begin to discuss Project B one week from today, as part of Class 19. Some (not all) of the materials for Project B are online, but I would wait until November 1 to get started.

## Taking Other Courses With Me

In addition to 431, I teach two other semester-long courses, called **PQHS 432** and **PQHS 500**. I will teach both 432 and 500 in Spring 2025. Here's my advice, for what it's worth ...

- **432** is the continuation of this course (widely regarded as the "better" half.) I think **everyone** in this class should be planning to take 432 this Spring (i.e. Spring 2025), **unless** you don't feel you've received sufficient value from this course and don't need to take 432 to finish your program at CWRU, **or** you have an unshakable conflict in Spring 2025 (especially if you plan to instead take 432 in Spring 2026.)
    - I will provide the 432 website and syllabus to everyone enrolled in 432 in mid-January. The Spring 2024 syllabus for 432 is [here](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-syllabus-2024/) but of course, things will change, in ways I will start to think about after Christmas. The 432 class is held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 to 2:15 PM.
- **500** is a project-based and more advanced course covering specific topics in the design and analysis of observational studies. 
    - I think everyone in this class who is interested in taking 500 should do so at some point. The course is mostly about using propensity scores well to help design (and analyze) data from observational studies where we want to estimate a causal effect.
    - A revised syllabus for the Spring 2025 version of the course will be available in mid-January. The Spring 2024 syllabus for 500 is [here](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-syllabus-2024/), but of course, things will change in ways I will start to think about after Christmas. The 500 course is held on Thursdays from 8:30 to 11 AM.
    - I especially think MS and PhD students (in any department) interested in applications of health research in real world situations should take it, as well as people looking for jobs in fields related to health care analytics.
    - For some people, it's better to complete 432 before taking 500 for several reasons, most especially ...
        1. percolation time for some of the ideas in 431/432
        2. too much of me at one time can be overwhelming
    - If Spring 2025 is your best opportunity to take 500, then I will certainly permit you to do so. Send me an email anytime if you want to discuss this.

## Come see [the play I'm in](https://www.auroracommunitytheatre.com/), if you like.

Or not. Your choice. 

"And Then There Were None" is one of Agatha Christie's most famous mysteries. The play begins when eight disparate guests arrive at an isolated mansion located on an island off the coast of Devon, and are tended to by two married domestics who prepared the house for their arrival. During the first evening a gramophone recording accuses all ten people of past crimes that went unpunished by the law. Soon they start dying one at a time, and the remaining guests deduce that the murderer is one of their own.

If you'd like to come, that would be great, and all of the information you need to buy tickets (they will **sell quickly**) is available by clicking the "Buy Tickets" link at <https://www.auroracommunitytheatre.com>. Tickets are $20. Performances are on Friday and Saturday evenings at 7:30 PM.

## If I'm a student/friend/neighbor/colleague of yours, are you expecting me to come see you in theater?

I'm always delighted to see anyone I know at any show I do. Please do come if you are interested, and comfortable being around people who are unmasked. 

I also have various professional roles (as a teacher, for example) where I have some nominal control over other people's happiness or work. If you're someone who interacts with me professionally, please feel no obligation to attend a show I'm in. Attending (or not attending) a show I'm in carries **no** weight with me at all in any professional capacity.

## One Last Thing

I'm not much of a Reddit guy, but [this is my favorite Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/hrljbe/askscience_ama_series_we_are_statistics/), I think. At least in a professional capacity.
