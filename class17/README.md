## Taking Other Courses With Me

In addition to 431, I teach two other semester-long courses, called **PQHS 432** and **PQHS 500**. I will teach both 432 and 500 in Spring 2025. Here's my advice, for what it's worth ...

- **432** is the continuation of this course (widely regarded as the "better" half.) I think **everyone** in this class should be planning to take 432 this Spring (i.e. Spring 2025), **unless** you don't feel you've received sufficient value from this course and don't need to take 432 to finish your program at CWRU, **or** you have an unshakable conflict in Spring 2025 (especially if you plan to instead take 432 in Spring 2026.)
    - I will provide the 432 website and syllabus to everyone enrolled in 432 in mid-January. The Spring 2024 syllabus for 432 is [here](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-syllabus-2024/) but of course, things will change, in ways I will start to think about after Christmas. The 432 class is held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 to 2:15 PM.
- **500** is a project-based and more advanced course covering specific topics in the design and analysis of observational studies. 
    - I think everyone in this class who is interested in taking 500 should do so at some point. The course is mostly about using propensity scores well to help design (and analyze) data from observational studies where we want to estimate a causal effect.
    - A revised syllabus for the Spring 2025 version of the course will be available in mid-January. The Spring 2024 syllabus for 500 is [here](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-syllabus-2024/), but of course, things will change in ways I will start to think about after Christmas. The 500 course is held on Thursdays from 8:30 to 11 AM.
    - I especially think MS and PhD students (in any department) interested in applications of health research in real world situations should take it, as well as people looking for jobs in fields related to health care analytics.
    - For some people, it's better to complete 432 before taking 500 for several reasons, most especially ...
        1. percolation time for some of the ideas in 431/432
        2. too much of me at one time can be overwhelming
    - If Spring 2025 is your best opportunity to take 500, then I will certainly permit you to do so. Send me an email anytime if you want to discuss this.
