## Favorite Movies

Consider the `movies_2024-09-12` Google Sheet now in our Shared Drive. 

- This file describes 228 movies selected as a "favorite movie" by students in 431 in the Fall 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 versions of the course. Next week, we'll do a little more work with these data, to help develop some research questions, but for today, we'll explore the data briefly, and look at how I developed the codebook.
