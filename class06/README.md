## Announcements

1. We'll spend some time today making sure you have a chance to discuss working on Project A with a partner, and address any of your questions about the Data or Proposal activites in Project A. We'll answer more questions next week, too.
2. Dr. Love's feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 5 will be posted before class.
3. Answer Sketch for Lab 1 will be posted Friday 2024-09-13 at noon to our Shared Google Drive.

## One Last Thing

We'll spend a few minutes looking at the `movies_2024-09-12` Google Sheet now in our Shared Drive. 

- This file describes 228 movies selected as a "favorite movie" by students in 431 in the Fall 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 versions of the course. Next week, we'll do a little more work with these data, to help develop some research questions, but for today, we'll explore the data briefly, and look at how I developed the codebook.
