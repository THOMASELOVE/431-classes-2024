## Monday 2024-12-09

- Monday presentations can be given either in person or via Zoom. It's your choice. **If your presentation is scheduled for Monday and you want to switch styles, let me know before December 1.**
- In person presentations are given at Dr. Love's office in Room WG-82J on the ground floor of the Wood building. Please arrive, ready to go, with a charged laptop, pen and paper, at the **Arrive At** time below. Please wait outside if the door is closed, and don't knock while I am in a presentation with someone else. I will open the door when I am ready for you.
- If you're presenting via Zoom, join the Zoom link by the **Arrive at** time. If I'm not ready for you, you will be placed in a waiting room.
- In early December, the Zoom link for Monday presentations will be emailed to people speaking that day, regardless of whether they're scheduled for Zoom or in person, so if something happens on the day and you need to switch to Zoom instead of in person, you can.
