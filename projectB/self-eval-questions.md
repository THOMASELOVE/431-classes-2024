# Questions on the Project B Self-Evaluation Form

The Project B Self-Evaluation form is found at <https://bit.ly/431-2024-projectB-self-evaluation>.

You shouldn't complete the form until after you complete the Project Presentation, and submit your Quarto, HTML and (if not using NHANES) data materials to Canvas, but you may want to see the questions in advance, so here they are:

**Questions for Everyone**

1. Of all of the time you spent doing project B, some was spent on getting the data ready (gathering, managing and cleaning the data) and then the rest was spent on what I'll call analysis for the moment. What percentage of your time on Project B was spent doing the data management and cleaning - that is, on the work you did before your analysis?
2. What was the hardest (or most difficult) thing to do during this project? (Your response should be at least two sentences long.)
3. Summarize a key finding from your Study 1 in your own well-chosen words. (Select one key finding, which might be from any of your four analyses. Your response should be 50-75 words long, and should specify which analysis you're describing (options are Analysis A, B, C, D or E))
4. Summarize a key finding of your Study 2 (the regression analyses) in your own well-chosen words. (Select one key finding. Your response should be 50-75 words long.)
5. How satisfied are you with the portfolio of written work (your Quarto and HTML) you're presenting in your final Project B? (You'll rate Study 1 and Study 2 separately, on a four-point scale from Completely Satisfied to Not Satisfied.)
6. How satisfied are you with how things went in your oral presentation with Dr. Love? (6 point scale from Not Satisfied at all to Completely Satisfied.)
7. What was the most important (or useful) thing that you learned about statistics/programming/data science doing this project? (Your response should be at least two sentences long.)

There's also an opportunity to tell me something more about Project B or the course, but I won't answer any questions posed there before January.

**Two Additional Questions Specifically for People With Partners**

1. If you worked with a partner, how well did it work out? (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor)
2. Do you feel that you and your partner each made a similarly meaningful contribution to the project? (A simple Yes is OK, especially if your answer to the previous question was Excellent or Very Good. If the answer to this question is No or if your answer to the previous question was Fair or Poor, please provide some details.)
