## From *Silver Bulletin*

> That’s because even a normal-sized polling error of 3 or 4 points across the board would make the Electoral College uninteresting. Harris beats her polls by that amount in every swing state, and it’s the biggest landslide since Obama in 2008 (she maybe wins Florida, too). If Trump beats his polls by that amount, it’s the worst election for Democrats in the Electoral College since 1988, though Harris might still win the popular vote. That’s the extent to which the race is really on a knife’s edge.
