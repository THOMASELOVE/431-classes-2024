## Announcements

1. There is a [Minute Paper](https://bit.ly/431-2024-minute-18) due Wednesday 2024-10-30 at noon. That link is <https://bit.ly/431-2024-minute-18>.
2. Your [Project A Portfolio](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2024/) is also due Wednesday 2024-10-30 at Noon.
    - Completing the portfolio means sending your (1) R data set, (2) Quarto file, (3) HTML result of rendering the Quarto file, and (4) video file (maximum 3 minutes, highlighting 2 of your analyses) to us via [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu), then completing (5) [the self-evaluation form](https://bit.ly/431-projectA-self-evaluation-2024).
    - If you're working with a partner, make sure that each of you (separately) complete [the self-evaluation form](https://bit.ly/431-projectA-self-evaluation-2024).
    - Please review the [detailed instructions for the highlight video](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2024/portfolio.html#the-highlight-video) with care. Details matter.
    - Updates on Project A Portfolio Submission (and later, Review) Status [will be found here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/blob/main/projectA/portfolio_review.md). 
    - We hope to complete grading on the Project A work and return feedback to you before Class 20 on Thursday 2024-11-07. You will receive an email with your grade and feedback.
    - Any grades you see pop up on Canvas over the next week are just ways for me to track whose work we've reviewed at various stages. They mean nothing regarding your actual grade on Project A.
3. Once you've completed Project A and the Minute Paper, good things to work on are [Lab 5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/tree/main/lab5), due 2024-11-06, and [Lab 7](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/tree/main/lab7).
    - I made a small addition to the Lab 5 instructions this morning (2024-10-29) to clarify what seed to use and how many bootstrap replications to use.
4. [Lab 6](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/tree/main/lab6) instructions are also available now, although we haven't covered everything you'll need to do that one yet.
5. Chapters 19-20 of the [Course Book](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/) are now available.
6. I will start to discuss [Project B](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2024/) on Thursday 2024-10-31.
7. Remember that I have cancelled 431 class on Election Day: next Tuesday 2024-11-05. CWRU, in general, is open that day, and TA office hours will be held that day.
8. If you haven't [updated your R packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/software.html#updating-your-r-packages) recently, now would be a good time to do so.

## If we have time...

I'll spend a few minutes on the [538 model of the US elections](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/) that conclude next Tuesday.

## And Then There Were None
