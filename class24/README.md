### Remaining Classes

- The "Ask Me Anything" Zoom session with Dr. Love will be [Class 25](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/tree/main/class25), on Tuesday 2024-12-03 (after Thanksgiving) at 1 PM.
    - "Anything" here isn't really accurate. I will answer anything at all about Project B, or the course generally, but I won't use this forum to answer specific questions about Quiz 2, unless you can be really clever about it, so I don't realize that's what you're asking. For Quiz questions, you'll have to email me.
- Our final class (Class 26) will be held in person on Thursday 2024-12-05. It's my favorite session of 431 each year, in some important ways, and I'll discuss Quiz 2, Project B, what happens in 432, and the future more generally, and some "fun" stuff.

### Thanksgiving Break

- I will not hold 431 during Thanksgiving week, on either Tuesday 2024-11-26 or Thursday 2024-11-28. I will respond to questions Campuswire several times that week.
- TA office hours for 431 are cancelled from Saturday 2024-11-23 through Saturday 2024-11-30, resuming Sunday 2024-12-01.

### Post-Thanksgiving Deadlines

- All three current "bonus opportunities" are due on Sunday 2024-12-01, or, technically, at 9 AM on Monday 2024-12-02.
