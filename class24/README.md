In today's class, we'll start by finishing up slides 43-54 from Class 23 (links below) before we move on to the Class 24 slides...

## Project B: Don't Forget the Basics

1. We don't want to see any messages or warnings in your R packages section. If you are going to continue to use R version 4.4.1, you will have to silence warnings as well as messages in your R setup section of your Project B.
2. Don't load any packages that are part of [the core tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/#core-tidyverse) separately, and don't load any of [the easystats packages](https://easystats.github.io/easystats/) separately. Load easystats next-to-last, and load tidyverse last.
3. Use # to create a section heading, ## to create a sub-section heading and ### to create a sub-sub-section heading. Don't use sub-sub-sub-sections.
4. Source `Love-431.R` in a way that is replicable. `source("Love-431.R")` or `source("data/Love-431.R")` are OK, as is identifying the `url` and sourcing that in, but what you cannot do is load the script by calling for a directory that no one else will have.
5. Be sure to set a theme for your ggplots as part of your R package section: I suggest either `theme_set(theme_bw())` or `theme_set(theme_lucid())`
6. Be sure to use `knitr:opts_chunk$set(comment=NA)` in your R package section.
7. When you submit to Canvas, be certain that both Study 1 and Study 2 are properly rendered and that the code is downloadable (by clicking the Code button, as displayed [here in the Study 1 sample report](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2024/sample-study1.html), or [here in the Study 2 sample report](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2024/sample-study2.html).)
8. Your YAML code should look something like this. In addition to changing the title, the subtitle, and the author, you may also want to change the html theme to another option. The [options for HTML themes are here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html). Don't use 431, Project or Study 1 in your main title. That'll be covered by the subtitle.

### Reminders: Thanksgiving Break

- I will not hold 431 class during Thanksgiving week, on either Tuesday 2024-11-26 or Thursday 2024-11-28. I will respond to questions posted to Campuswire (anything other than Quiz 2) or to my email (questions about Quiz 2) several times that week.
- [TA office hours](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/contact.html) for 431 are cancelled from Saturday 2024-11-23 through Saturday 2024-11-30, and will resume Sunday 2024-12-01.

### After Today, Two Remaining 431 Classes

- The "Ask Me Anything" Zoom session with Dr. Love will be [Class 25](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/tree/main/class25), on Tuesday 2024-12-03 (after Thanksgiving) at 1 PM. I'll email the Zoom link to you the day before (and it's already posted to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu), too.)
    - "Anything" here isn't really accurate. I will answer anything at all about Project B, or the course generally, but I won't use this forum to answer specific questions about Quiz 2, unless you can be really clever about it, so I don't realize that's what you're asking. For Quiz questions, you'll have to email me.
- Our final class (Class 26) will be held in person on Thursday 2024-12-05. It's my favorite session of 431 each year, in some important ways, and I'll discuss Quiz 2, Project B, what happens in 432, and the future more generally, and some "fun" stuff. There will be candy, thanks to Zuhair Khan.

### 431 Post-Thanksgiving Deadlines

- All three current "bonus opportunities" are due on Sunday 2024-12-01, or, technically, at 9 AM on Monday 2024-12-02.
- [Quiz 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2024/tree/main/quiz2) **and** [Lab 7](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/tree/main/lab7) are **both** due on Wednesday 2024-12-04 at noon. (Lab 7 cannot be "skipped".)
    - Congratulations to those of [you who have already completed Lab 7](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/tree/main/lab7#new-completed-websites-by-students-in-this-years-class)!
- Everyone's [Project B presentation is scheduled](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/blob/main/projectB/schedule.md) for December 6, 9, 10 or 11.
- All [Project B written materials](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2024/checklist.html) are due on Wednesday 2024-12-11 at noon.
