# Favorite Movies

On our Shared Google Drive in the `Favorite Movies` subfolder, you'll find a series of data sets (Google Sheet workbooks) describing 228 films that people taking either the 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 or 2024 versions of 431 identified as their "Favorite Movie". 

- The original version was `movies_2024-09-17`.
- The current version is `movies_2024-10-01`.

- For each movie, I gathered a series of characteristics, at first mostly from the [Internet Movie Data Base](https://www.imdb.com/) (IMDB), and descriptions of these characteristics are found in the **Variable Descriptions** tab.
- Here is a convenient [list of the 228 movies](movie_list.md), including links to their IMDB page, and the IMDB short synopsis of each movie.

## Breakout Session 1

- Here's our [first breakout activity](breakout1.md), which we will go through in Class 08 (2024-09-19). It uses the `movies_2024-09-17` version of the data.
- Here's some [results of that first breakout](breakout1_results.md) which may be of interest to you. We'll discuss them, along with some more statistical results, in Class 09 (2024-09-24).

## Breakout Session 2
