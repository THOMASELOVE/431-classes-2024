# Favorite Movies

On our Shared Google Drive in the `Favorite Movies` subfolder, you'll find a data set (a Google Sheet called `movies_2024-09-17`) containing 228 films that people taking either the 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 or 2024 versions of 431 identified as their "Favorite Movie". 

For each movie, I gathered 18 characteristics, mostly from the [Internet Movie Data Base](https://www.imdb.com/) (IMDB), and descriptions of these characteristics are found in the **Variable Descriptions** tab.
