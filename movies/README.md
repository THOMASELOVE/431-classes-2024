# Favorite Movies

On our Shared Google Drive in the `Favorite Movies` subfolder, you'll find a data set (a Google Sheet workbook called `movies_2024-09-17`) containing 228 films that people taking either the 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 or 2024 versions of 431 identified as their "Favorite Movie". An Excel workbook containing the same two tabs and same information [is available for download here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/blob/main/movies/movies_2024-09-17.xlsx).

- For each movie, I gathered 18 characteristics, mostly from the [Internet Movie Data Base](https://www.imdb.com/) (IMDB), and descriptions of these characteristics are found in the **Variable Descriptions** tab.
- Here is a convenient [list of the 228 movies](movie_list.md), including links to their IMDB page, and the IMDB short synopsis of each movie.
