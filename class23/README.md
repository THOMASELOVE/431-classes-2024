## Announcements

1. [Lab 6](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/tree/main/lab6) is due tomorrow (Wednesday 2024-11-20) at noon.
    - The answer sketch will be posted to our Shared Drive folder by noon on Friday 2024-11-22.
    - We will drop the lowest lab score of Labs 1-6 when building your grade. However, I wouldn't recommend skipping Lab 6 unless you really are in a bind with regard to your other work at the moment and your Lab grade based on Labs 1-5 is 90% or higher. Even then, I strongly recommend looking over the Lab and its answer sketch before you complete Quiz 2 and Project B. If you decide to skip Lab 6, please place a note on Canvas by the deadline to that effect. Thanks.
2. There is also a [Minute Paper after Class 23](https://bit.ly/431-2024-minute-23) due tomorrow (Wednesday 2024-11-20) at noon.
    - The link is <https://bit.ly/431-2024-minute-23>. Thanks.
3. **Remaining Classes**
    - [Class 24](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/tree/main/class24) will be held as usual, in person, this Thursday 2024-11-21.
    - You will receive [Quiz 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2024/tree/main/quiz2) on Thursday 2024-11-21 by 5 PM. Some initial materials [are available now](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2024/tree/main/quiz2).
    - The "Ask Me Anything" Zoom session with Dr. Love will be [Class 25](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/tree/main/class25), on Tuesday 2024-12-03 (after Thanksgiving) at 1 PM. "Anything" here isn't really accurate. I will answer anything at all about Project B, or the course generally, but I won't use this forum to answer specific questions about Quiz 2.
    - Our final class (Class 26) will be held in person on Thursday 2024-12-05.
4. **Thanksgiving Break**
    - I will not hold 431 during Thanksgiving week, on either Tuesday 2024-11-26 or Thursday 2024-11-28. I will respond to questions Campuswire several times that week.
    - TA office hours for 431 are cancelled from Saturday 2024-11-23 through Saturday 2024-11-30, resuming Sunday 2024-12-01.
5. **Post-Thanksgiving Deadlines**
    - All three current "bonus opportunities" are due on Sunday 2024-12-01, or, technically, at 9 AM on Monday 2024-12-02.
    - [Quiz 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2024/tree/main/quiz2) **and** [Lab 7](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/tree/main/lab7) are due on Wednesday 2024-12-04 at noon. (Lab 7 cannot be "skipped".)
    - Congratulations to those of [you who have already completed Lab 7](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/tree/main/lab7#new-completed-websites-by-students-in-this-years-class)!
    - All [Project B written materials](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2024/checklist.html) are due on Wednesday 2024-12-11 at noon.
6. The revised [Project B presentation schedule is available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/blob/main/projectB/schedule.md). All 43 Project B registration plans are approved. Please check that I have your information correctly summarized there. If I don't, send me an email.
7. Were I you, I would [update RStudio to the latest version](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (2024.09.1+394) if you haven't already. It's not vital, but useful, and shouldn't be disruptive.
    - As for updating R, I have now upgraded to R version 4.4.2 for slides and other materials, but you can work with either R version 4.4.1 or 4.4.2 for the remainder of 2024.
8. I am not going to be able to finish Chapters 21-22 (or 23) for the [431 Book](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/) this semester. Things have just gotten away from me on that project.
    - We have covered some of the material planned for those chapters in class, and will cover some of the rest in class this week.
    - The chapters themselves will remain as they are, probably until summer 2025. I apologize, and I've noted this in the latest version of the posted book.
9. Someone was good enough to point out to me the need to clarify something about how the quizzes are incorporated into your final grade in Section 11.1 of the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2024/). I've made that fix.
