        - Multiple "bonus opportunities" (on Campuswire and elsewhere) are active, and have been for a little while.
    - [Quiz 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2024/tree/main/quiz2) and Lab 7 are due on Wednesday 2024-12-04 at noon.
    - Regardless of when you give your Project B presentation, your Project B written materials are due to Canvas on Wednesday 2024-12-11 at noon.
6. The revised [Project B presentation schedule is available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/blob/main/projectB/schedule.md). Please check that I have your information correctly summarized. If I don't, send me an email.
7. Were I you, I would [update RStudio to the latest version](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (2024.09.1+394) if you haven't already. It's not vital, but useful, and shouldn't be disruptive.
    - As for updating R, I have now upgraded to R version 4.4.2 for slides and other materials, but you can work with either R version 4.4.1 or 4.4.2 for the remainder of 2024.
