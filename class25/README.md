## Announcements

1. Today's Class 25 is an "Ask Me Anything" / Project B Help Session conducted by Dr. Love over Zoom during our usual class time. The Zoom link is on Canvas, and will also appear in your email on the morning of the class session.
    - "Anything" here isn't really accurate. I will answer anything at all about Project B, or the course generally, but I won't use this forum to answer specific questions about Quiz 2. Questions about Quiz 2 should just be emailed to me.
2. Lab 6 grades and feedback are now available in the 431 Student Grade Roster in our Shared Drive folder.
3. The entire session will be recorded and posted to Canvas after class, if you want to review any part of it later.
4. Thanks to an alert student, I've corrected small typos in section 17.7.3 (misspelled "more" as "mode") and in section 18.6 (the median APE is smaller in Model 2) of [the course text](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/). The revised version should be posted by class time.

## Today's Topics of Discussion

1. I will provide some reminders about [Lab 7](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/tree/main/lab7), due tomorrow (Wednesday 2024-12-04) at noon.
2. I will provide some reminders and hints about [Quiz 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2024/tree/main/quiz2), also due tomorrow (Wednesday 2024-12-04) at noon.
3. I will provide some reminders about [Project B presentations](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/blob/main/projectB/schedule.md), as well.
    - You should have received an email from me (at your CWRU email) on Monday 2024-12-02 containing Zoom information for your presentation.
    - My advice and a description of what will happen during the presentations [can be found here](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2024/checklist.html#oral-presentation-of-results).
4. I will also provide some more general reminders about [Project B](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2024/).
    - All written materials for Project B are due on Wednesday 2024-12-11 at noon.
    - Even if you're working as a pair, **each** of you should separately submit the [Self-Evaluation form for Project B](https://bit.ly/431-2024-projectB-self-evaluation) by the deadline. Be sure to fill out the form **after** you give your presentation via Zoom. The list of questions on the Self-Evaluation Form [is available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/blob/main/projectB/self-eval-questions.md), since you haven't given your presentation yet.
    - By Wednesday 2024-12-11 at noon, you should submit via [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu): (1) your study 1 Quarto file and HTML result and (2) your study 2 Quarto file and HTML result, plus (3) the data set you used to ingest the data into R **if you are not using NHANES data**. While you are welcome to submit this material in advance, I expect you to submit this to Canvas **after** you give your presentation.
        - If you are working with a partner, exactly one of you should submit the materials to Canvas, while the other should just submit a short note (pdf or Word document) telling me who will submit those materials for your group.
5. I'll also remind you about the optional [Lab Regrade Request Form](https://bit.ly/431-2024-lab-regrade-request), which is also due on Wednesday 2024-12-11 at noon.
6. I'll provide some information about your favorite songs, [as requested here](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2024/checklist.html#a-special-note).
    - The Fall 2024 playlist [is available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G-YQA_bsOU&list=PL1WkTI58HjcjAdtJOkV3GFtFCEZR82Jmn), with 49 songs.
    - We also have a [Fall 2023 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmjG6p8LN4o&list=PL1WkTI58Hjcivws3CSv-xCLROR7-cEFgH) with 45 songs, and a [Fall 2022 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-q559-hhUA&list=PL1WkTI58HjchPCLLYcV3q48LluH5z8aeN) with 55 songs.
7. I'll talk a little about what will happen in Thursday's final class of the semester.
    - The short answer is that I will talk about Quiz 2 (which I hope to have graded by then), [how I calculate your course grade](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/blob/main/class25/431-grade-calculation-2024-fall.pdf), some closing thoughts about 431 and give a brief look forward to 432.
    - Unfortunately, this will all happen via Zoom, thanks to my leg. Again, all of the information for that Zoom session is on Canvas, and will also appear in your email. It's the same setup for both classes this week as it has been all semester.

Having discussed all that stuff, I will then take your questions with all the grace I can muster.

Thanks for your patience.
