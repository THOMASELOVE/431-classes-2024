There are no slides for today's session.

## Announcements

1. Today's Class 25 is an "Ask Me Anything" / Project B Help Session conducted by Dr. Love over Zoom during our usual class time. The Zoom link is on Canvas, and will also appear in your email on the morning of the class session.
    - "Anything" here isn't really accurate. I will answer anything at all about Project B, or the course generally, but I won't use this forum to answer specific questions about Quiz 2. Questions about Quiz 2 should just be emailed to me.
2. I expect that grades and feedback on Lab 6 will be posted **by class time**.

## Today's Topics of Discussion

1. I will provide some reminders about [Lab 7](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/tree/main/lab7), due tomorrow (Wednesday 2024-12-04) at noon.
2. I will provide some reminders and hints about [Quiz 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2024/tree/main/quiz2), also due tomorrow (Wednesday 2024-12-04) at noon.
3. I will provide some reminders about [Project B presentations](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/blob/main/projectB/schedule.md), as well.
    - You should have received an email from me (at your CWRU email) on Monday 2024-12-02 containing Zoom information for your presentation.
    - My advice and a description of what will happen during the presentations [can be found here](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2024/checklist.html#oral-presentation-of-results).
4. I will also provide some more general reminders about [Project B](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2024/).
    - All written materials for Project B are due on Wednesday 2024-12-11 at noon.
    - Even if you're working as a pair, each of you should separately submit the [Self-Evaluation form for Project B](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2024/self_eval.html) by the deadline. Be sure to fill out the form **after** you give your presentation via Zoom.
    - By Wednesday 2024-12-11 at noon, you should submit via Canvas: (1) a study 1 Quarto file and (2) study 1 HTML result and (3) a study 2 Quarto file and (4) study 2 HTML result, plus the (5) data set you used to ingest the data into R if you are not using NHANES data.
        - If you are working with a partner, exactly one of you should submit those materials to Canvas, while the other should just submit a short note (pdf or Word document) telling me who will submit those materials for your group.
5. I'll also remind you about the optional [Lab Regrade Request Form](https://bit.ly/431-2024-lab-regrade-request), which is also due on Wednesday 2024-12-11 at noon.
6. I'll provide some information about your favorite songs, [as requested here](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2024/checklist.html#a-special-note).
7. I'll talk a little about what will happen in Thursday's final class of the semester.
    - The short answer is that I will talk about Quiz 2 (which I hope to have graded by then), grading more generally, some closing thoughts about 431 and give a brief look forward to 432.
    - Unfortunately, this will all happen via Zoom, thanks to my leg. Again, all of the information for that Zoom session is on Canvas, and will also appear in your email. It's the same setup for both classes this week as it has been all semester.
8. Then, I will happily take your questions.
9. The entire session will be recorded and posted to Canvas after class, if you want to review any part of it later.
