## Today's Opener: The Quick Survey

As you come in, **please take** (from the box at the back table) a paper survey with 15 questions. Please read these instructions carefully before writing anything down.

1. Introduce yourself to someone near you.
2. Record the survey answers **for that other person**, while they record your responses.
3. Be sure to complete all 15 questions (both sides of the paper).
4. When you are finished, thank your partner and raise your hand. Someone will come around to collect your survey.

There is a [PDF copy of the Quick Survey here](431_surveyhandout_1perstudent_2024-08-29.pdf), if you'd like to look at the form after your paper copy has been collected.

## Today's Slides

Class | Date | Slides | Word .docx | Quarto .qmd | Recording
:---: | :--------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :-------------:
02 | 2024-08-29 | **[Slides 02](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-slides-2024/class02.html)** | **[Word 02](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-slides-2024/class02w.docx)** | **[Code 02](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-slides-2024/blob/main/class02.qmd)** | Visit [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), select **Zoom** and **Cloud Recordings**

- The HTML link provides the (RevealJS) version of the slides that I suggest you focus on during class.
- The Word link will let you download the material in the slides as a Word (.docx) document.
    - Some people prefer this to the HTML version for live note-taking.
- The Quarto file link provides the code I used (in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) to build the slides. Hit the download button after clicking the link above if you want the `.qmd` file.
- To print RevealJS slides **to pdf**, [follow these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) using Google Chrome as your browser.
- We attempt to record **most** 431 classes via Zoom and post the recording to Canvas.

## Announcements

1. TA Office Hours will begin on Tuesday 2024-09-03. Our Shared Google Drive (431 Fall 2024 Dr Love and Students) contains Zoom links for these sessions in a document called **TA office hours schedule and Zoom links**.
2. If there's anyone in the room today who is **not yet registered** for the course, see me after class. Thank you.

## Things to Do This Weekend

1. Read through the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2024/).
    - Hint: I'll know on **Tuesday at 9 AM** if you've done this. Thanks to those of you who have.
2. By Tuesday's class, we're hoping you will read the introduction and Chapter 1 of Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data* as well as sections 1-3 of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).
3. Bookmark the [main course website](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/), and the books [R for Data Science, 2nd ed.](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), the [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/), and perhaps [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/). I would also bookmark the [Posit Cheat Sheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/) page.
4. [Install the software](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/software.html) and [R packages, data and code](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/software.html#installing-r-packages-and-datacode-for-431) you'll need.
5. Take a look at the following items:
    - the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/calendar.html), to see what's ahead of you
    - the [Course Text](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/) (where I would try to skim from the start through Chapter 3),
    - and at your first substantial assignment: [Lab 01 (due 2024-09-11)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024).
6. **Ask us questions**. TA office hours start Tuesday, but [Campuswire is available now](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/campuswire.html).
