## Announcements

1. I fixed two tiny typos (slides 25 and 27) in the [Slides for Class 18](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/tree/main/class18). Nothing that should affect you much, but the new versions (HTML and Word) are posted. Thanks to the student who brought these to my attention.
2. [Lab 6](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/tree/main/lab6) is due next Wednesday 2024-11-20 at noon. I revised the instructions on 2024-11-12, so make sure you have the revised version (as the changes I made should save you a lot of time in doing the Lab.)
3. **Project B**
    - The schedule for Project B Presentations [is now available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/blob/main/projectB/schedule.md).
    - We will walk through several issues related to the Project B plans today. My [review of the project B plans is available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/blob/main/projectB/registration.md) and there is valuable stuff here for everyone, even if I've already approved your plan.
    - If your plan is [not yet approved](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/blob/main/projectB/registration.md), then respond to my email (sent Wednesday evening 2024-11-13) to get that resolved with me as soon as possible.
4. I added two more packages, **here** and **mosaic**, to our list of [packages to install in R](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-packages/blob/main/README.md). We'll demonstrate their use today.

## Our New Packages and some Nice R Resources

Recently, we've added `gt`, `nhanesA`, `mosaic` and `here` (and, less recently, `mice`) to our tool set.

- [Project MOSAIC website](https://www.mosaic-web.org/) including [R resources](https://www.mosaic-web.org/R-packages.html) and [free books on statistical thinking](https://www.mosaic-web.org/mosaic-books.html)
- The [mosaic package](https://www.mosaic-web.org/mosaic/) website, including resources describing options for [favstats()](https://www.mosaic-web.org/mosaic/reference/fav_stats.html), [df_stats()](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/mosaicCore/html/df_stats.html) and [inspect()](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/mosaicCore/html/inspect.html).
- The [here package](https://here.r-lib.org/) website, and Jenny Bryan's [Ode to the here package](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here)
- The [gt package](https://gt.rstudio.com/) website
- Stef van Buuren's book on multiple imputation (and mice, in particular) [Flexible Imputation of Missing Data](https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/)
