## As you walk in...

Be sure to get one of the "A Convenient Piece of Paper" handouts. **Don't** write on it yet. Instead, get to know those around you.

## This is the README page for Class 01.

Each class' README serves as a starting point for that class session.
The main website for this class is <https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/>. From that site, get to this README by

- selecting **Calendar**
- then selecting today's class (Class 01).
- Direct Link to this page is: <https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/tree/main/class01>

## Today's Slides

Class | Date | Slides | Word .docx | Quarto .qmd | Recording
:---: | :--------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :-------------:
01 | 2024-08-27 | **[Slides 01](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-slides-2024/class01.html)** | **[Word 01](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-slides-2024/class01w.docx)** | **[Code 01](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-slides-2024/blob/main/class01.qmd)** | Visit [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), select **Zoom** and **Cloud Recordings**

- The HTML link provides the (RevealJS) version of the slides that I suggest you focus on during class.
- The Word link will let you download the material in the slides as a Word (.docx) document.
    - Some people prefer this to the HTML version for live note-taking.
- The Quarto file link provides the code I used (in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) to build the slides. Hit the download button after clicking the link above if you want the `.qmd` file.
- To print RevealJS slides **to pdf**, [follow these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) using Google Chrome as your browser.
- We attempt to record **most** 431 classes via Zoom and post the recording to Canvas.

## Announcements

1. Thank you to those of you who've completed the [Welcome to 431 Survey](https://bit.ly/431-2024-welcome) (48 out of 58 as of 10 PM Monday) 
    - If you haven't completed this yet, please do so today. The deadline is **tomorrow (Wednesday 2024-08-28) at Noon**.
    - Dr. Love will discuss the Survey results once they are complete. 
        - For now, I'll agree that there's a lot of work in this course, but your predecessors have found it rewarding.
    - If you are **not yet enrolled** in this class, please talk to me before you leave this room. 
        - We're overly full here, but there is a Section 2 of 431 from 4:00 - 5:15 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 

2. As part of our slides today, we'll visit [the main course page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/) for the course, and look over:

- the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2024/)
- the [Course Book](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/) (Foundations of Applied Statistics and R)
- the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/calendar.html), which is the final word for all deadlines in this course
- the [Assignments](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/assignments.html), including the Minute Papers, Labs, Quizzes, and Projects.
- the information available on [getting R and R Studio](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/software.html#installing-r-and-r-studio) and some [R packages and data sets](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/software.html#installing-r-packages-and-datacode-for-431) installed on your computer. You will need administrator authority on your computer to get this done.
- the [Campuswire discussion forum](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/campuswire.html) for the class, and other [ways you can get help from us](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/contact.html).
    - [Campuswire](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/campuswire.html) is the best place to ask (and answer) questions outside of class time.
    - It's also where I'll post key information between classes, so sign up today!
- TA Office Hours will begin on Tuesday 2023-09-03. All are held via Zoom.
    - The schedule will be available on our [Contact Us](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/contact.html) and [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/calendar.html) pages, while the Zoom links will be found in a document on our Shared Google Drive.
    - Find the shared drive listed as **431 Fall 2024 Dr Love and Students** on your CWRU Google Drive.
- the [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) page for the course, which we use only as a place to turn in some assignments.

3. Posit (makers of RStudio) publish [incredibly useful Cheat Sheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/), which are a great source of help, too.

## Ten Things To Do After Class 01 (if you haven't, already)

1. Bookmark and familiarize yourself with the [main course website](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/), being sure to visit the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/calendar.html) and see what's ahead of you.
2. Read through the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2024/).
3. Obtain David Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data* (~$20), and read the Introduction and Chapter 1.
    - Our [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/calendar.html) provides reading deadlines. Try to keep up.
4. Complete the [Welcome to 431 survey](https://bit.ly/431-2024-welcome), if you haven't yet. Thanks if you've already done this.
5. Get started [installing the software](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/software.html) you'll need.
6. Sign up for the (free) [Campuswire discussion forum](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/campuswire.html) and ask a question or leave a comment.
7. Take a look at the [Course Book](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/). Chapters 1-4 are complete, I think, and you should at least skim through Chapters 1-3 this week.
8. You should also bookmark [R for Data Science, 2nd ed.](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), the [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/), and perhaps [Introduction to Modern Statistics, 2nd ed.](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/). Each of these books is very useful. I would also bookmark the [Posit Cheat Sheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/) page.
9. Ask us questions. TA office hours start next Tuesday, but [Campuswire is available as soon as class ends](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/campuswire.html).
10. Take a look at [Lab 01 (due 2024-09-11 at noon)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024) which is your first substantial deliverable, as well as the [instructions for Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2024/).
