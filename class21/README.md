## Announcements

1. The Project B registration form is available at <https://bit.ly/431-projB-registration-2024>. That's due tomorrow (Wednesday 2024-11-13) at noon.
    - I hope that the Sample Study 1 and Sample Study 2 materials for Project B will be in your hands **by class time**.

3. **Lab updates**
    - **Lab 7**: (due 2024-12-04) Nihit Mehta was kind enough to write up some [detailed instructions for getting your Lab 7 website published to Github](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/blob/main/lab7/lab7_publishing_advice_for_github.pdf), after following Marvin Schmitt's tutorial. See the [Lab 7 page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/blob/main/lab7/README.md) for more instructions, and for examples of Nihit's site and those of several other students.
    - **Lab 6**: (due 2024-11-20) Thanks to an alert student, I fixed typos in [Lab 6](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024/blob/main/lab6/README.md) where I'd inadvertently used both Lab 4 and Lab 5 when I meant Lab 6.
    - **Lab 5**: The Answer Sketch for Lab 5 is now available in our Shared Google Drive folder. Grades and feedback will, I hope, be in your hands **by class time**.
4. **Project A**: Details on Project A review are here. Grades and feedback will, I hope, be in your hands **by class time**.
