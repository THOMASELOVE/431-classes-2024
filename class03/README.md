- The HTML link provides the (RevealJS) version of the slides that I suggest you focus on during class.
- The Word link will let you download the material in the slides as a Word (.docx) document.
    - Some people prefer this to the HTML version for live note-taking.
- The Quarto file link provides the code I used (in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) to build the slides. Hit the download button after clicking the link above if you want the `.qmd` file.
- To print RevealJS slides **to pdf**, [follow these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) using Google Chrome as your browser.
- We attempt to record **most** 431 classes via Zoom and post the recording to Canvas.

## Ten Interesting/Fun Facts about Students in this semester's 431 class

1. I am a swimmer and a ventriloquist.
2. I enjoy crocheting in my free time.
3. I have a one-year-old baby boy.
4. I hiked 3000 km from Lusaka, Zambia through Mozambique and down to Cape Town, South Africa.
5. I love to sketch and cook.

10. [Billy Mays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Mays) (the OxiClean pitch man) was my uncle!

These come from the Welcome to 431 survey - some more results from that survey [can be found here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/blob/main/class02/welcome-report.md).

- Saturday, I sang, danced and acted with the Hudson Players in the [Ohio Community Theatre Association](https://www.octa1953.org/)'s state competition, where the adjudicators positively described my performance in their comments and, in particular, singled out my shoes.

## Announcements
 
1. Your next assignment is a [Minute Paper after Class 03](https://bit.ly/431-2024-minute-03), which you need to complete by NOON Wednesday 2023-09-04 (tomorrow). A Minute Paper is a short survey (completed using a Google Form) where you will answer a few questions about how the course is going for you.
    - You'll need to be logged into Google via CWRU to complete the Minute Papers. 
    - **Always** complete the Minute Paper even if you weren’t able to attend the most recent class. 
    - More on the Minute Papers [here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-minute-2024), and [in the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2024/10_assignments.html#minute-papers).

2. If you’ve spent 15 minutes working on something and are stuck, don’t keep working on it. Step away for a while, and if you return and are still stuck, **ASK FOR HELP**.
    - Use our [Campuswire discussion board](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/campuswire.html) to ask (and answer) questions about the course. Open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
    - Attend [TA office hours](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/contact.html) (which began earlier today) to get one-on-one help or share a computer problem. Our Shared Google Drive (431 Fall 2023 Dr Love and Students) contains Zoom links for TA office hours in a document called **TA office hours schedule and Zoom links**. Those links are also posted to Campuswire and Canvas. No appointment is necessary. Please just drop in.
    - Professor Love will also hold "drop-in" office hours before and after each class.
    - Email Professor Love if you have any questions you don't feel comfortable asking in TA office hours or via Campuswire.
    - The following students still need to register for Campuswire - please do this **today** by [visiting this link](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/campuswire.html).
        - Saar Anis, Gabrielle Davis, Jose Diz Ferre, Shraddha Dumawat, Leia George, Derek Host, Brooke Jurasius, Anika Krishna, Tom Kupferer, Chunxuan Ma, Katherine Papahadjoulos, Toni Shoyinka, and Yen Jui (Tim) Su.

3. Now is the time (if you haven't already) to [get started on Lab 01](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2024), which is due next Wednesday 2024-09-11 at Noon. 
    - We have provided you [with a template for Lab 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/blob/main/data/lab1-template.qmd) to help you get started.
    - You may want to do Task 5 (which involves creating a short video) first, to get it out of the way, as it doesn't require any of the material discussed in class.
    - Prior to attempting Lab 1, we assume ...
        - You've reviewed the materials discussed in 431 Classes 1-4,
        - You've looked over Chapters 1-4 of [Dr. Love's 431 book](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/),
        - You've read the introduction and chapters 1 and 2 of David Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics*,
        - You've read the introduction and (most of) the "Whole Game" part (chapters 1-8) of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).

4. **15-item Survey** You may recall my mentioning that over the past ten years, 547 students had taken a version of our 15-item quick survey, and that 196/547 (36%) caused no problems in deciphering the results. The updated results through 2024 are 217/603 (still 36%), and the 2024 results were 21/56 (37.5%).
    - Also, as I mentioned on Campuswire, I am roughly 6 feet 2.25 inches tall these days, which is about 188 cm.
    - My answers to some of the other survey questions:
        - I don't wear glasses (except reading glasses on occasion). English is my best language. I have never smoked, not even on stage.
        - My handedness score is +0.5 (four plus marks on L and 12 on R), although, for example, I shoot pool better left-handed.
        - My last haircut cost me $45, including the tip. My favorite color is purple.
        - My hand span is just over 26 inches, which is the largest this year (and most years.)
        - I slept 6.5 hours the night before our class 2, and my pulse rate at the start of that class was 84 beats per minute.
    - Changes to the survey over the years:
        - `glasses` item added in 2019, `love's height` added in 2021
        - `sex` asked in 2014-2018, `love's age` guessed in 2014-2019
        - `statssofar`, `handedness`, `pulse` rate and `hand_span` not included in 2020 (COVID-related modifications since the course was exclusively given through Zoom)

## Extra Materials for Class 03 found in the [Class 03 data subfolder](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/tree/main/class03/data)

These items are also part of the updated [431-data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data).

- [431-first-r-template.qmd](data/431-first-r-template.qmd) is the **template** I will start with in developing today's materials.
- [431-class03-all-code.qmd](data/431-class03-allcode.qmd) is a revision of the template that includes all of the code I will develop today in [the slides](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-slides-2024/class03.html).
- [quick_survey_2024.csv](data/quick_survey_2024.csv) contains the data from our [Quick Survey in Class 02 (pdf)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2024/blob/main/class02/431_surveyhandout_1perstudent_2024-08-29.pdf) for you and for students in the 2014-2023 versions of 431.

### Analytic Questions We'll Address Today

1. What is the distribution of pulse rates among students in 431 since 2014?
2. Does the distribution of student heights change materially over time?
3. Is the Normal distribution a good model for student heights? How about student haircut prices?
4. Do taller people appear to have paid less for their most recent haircut?
5. Do students have a more substantial tobacco history if they prefer to speak English or a language other than English?

### R Tools We'll Demonstrate Using Today's Materials

In addition to demonstrating general approaches for creating R projects and Quarto files, and loading R packages, we'll demonstrate most of the following key ideas...

1. Ingesting data with `read_csv()` from a csv (comma-separated version text) file to create a tibble (data frame.)
2. Six key verbs from the `tidyverse`: `count()`, `filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()`, `group_by()` and `summarize()`
3. Using the pipe: `|>` to push information through a pipeline.
4. Using the assignment operator `<-` to assign results to a variable or tibble or other sort of object.
5. Summarizing data with `summary()`, `tabyl()` and with `describe_distribution()`
6. Dealing with missing data via the creation of complete-case analyses with `filter(complete.cases())`
7. Converting categorical variables to factors with `as_factor())`
8. Building plots using `ggplot` and the `ggplot2` package
    - Setting the x and y variables with `aes()`
    - Using `geom_histogram()` to obtain histograms of quantities
    - Using `geom_boxplot()` and `geom_violin()` for comparisons of quantities across categories (groups)
    - Using `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()` to build scatterplots of the association between quantities and fit linear models and loess smooths to data
    - Using `labs()` to set axis labels, main and sub-titles
    - Using `guides(col = "none")` to delete legends from a plot where color is used to separate groups
9. Using `lm()` to fit and `model_parameters()` to summarize a straight-line ordinary least squares linear regression model
10. Using `xfun::session_info()` to describe information about your installation of R at the end of your session.

All of this material is also demonstrated in Chapters 1-4 of the [Course Text](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-book/), and we will review (and augment) these ideas in class over the next few weeks.

5. If you're not already signed up for [Campuswire](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2024/campuswire.html) (as indicated above) please get that done today.

## One Last Thing

Thanks very much to the **31** of you who completed the requirements of [Section 13 of the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2024/13_movies.html) on time, and thus received a little class participation credit. Opportunities like this will appear through the semester, so keep an eye out for them. 

In the meantime, those of you who didn't complete this task already, **please do so today**. Thanks!
